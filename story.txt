Once upon a time there was a good programmer who used git. He committed
regularly and wrote useful messages.

One day, he wrote buggy code! But thankfully he was able to reset to an
earlier commit. Instead of having to rewrite his entire project, he was
able to just restart the buggy feature.

In the end, the good programmer was able to store his elegant code in an
arctic code vault for all of eternity, all thanks to git and the magical
website github.

(Way too bland, but who cares!)
